# Analysis of the co-ocurrence network of the characters in the Game of Thrones books.
The project uses the fundamentals of network analysis and network science to determine the most important character of the famous Game of Thrones books. 
The analysis is done with the help of python 3.8's networkx library. However, network science offers us many metrics to measure a node's 'importance' in a graphh, so there's no fixed measure that can be used to pinpoint the most important node in a graph.
